Use BIP39 words to locate anywhere in the world!

what3words is cool, but it's closed, and there is no guarantee they wont change their words :(

Where39 uses the BIP39 word-list, the most distributed word-list in the world 

https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/bip-0039-wordlists.md

Locate anywhere to extreme accuracy using only 4-5 words!

x4 words for 5 m<sup>2</sup> accuracy

x5 words for 1 ft<sup>2</sup> accuracy

* "My location" will give you your current location words

* You can also click on the map to get location words

* By using the 4 word search you can find a specific location anywhere in the world

* For extra privacy the shuffle function shuffles the BIP39 wordlist. Only people you share the number with will be able to make sense of your word locations.


# How it works
## 1st word
First we break the earth into tiles 32/64, 2048 tiles (the amount of words in the BIP32 wordlist). We allocate each tile a word, this is achieved by using the earths latitude (180 degrees) and logitude (360 degrees). 
Each tile is 5.625/5.625 degrees.

## 2nd word
This square is split into 2025 smaller tiles 45/45, which works out 0.125/0.125 degrees per tile.

## 3rd word
This square is split into 2025 smaller tiles 45/45, which works out 0.00277777777/0.00277777777 degrees per tile.

## 4th word
This square is split into 2025 smaller tiles 45/45, which works out 0.00006172839/0.00006172839 degrees per tile.

## 5th word
The 5th word is the tresure word, and usually not necessary. We can split this square into 400 smaller tiles 20/20, which works out 0.00000308642/0.00000308642 degrees per tile.
